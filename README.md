# Product Owner Test

Welcome to the QuickSeries SCRUM Product Owner take home test. In order to test your writing skills and your ability to translate complexe technical language into language that can be consumed by non-technical individuals, we would like to do the follow two things:

* Write 3 to 5 users stories along with the acceptance criteria
* Write release notes

## Instructions

Submit your answers in Text, Word or Apple Pages format by email to your recruiter or directly to the hiring manager you have spoken to. Allow a minimum of 1 to 2 business days for us to review the results and give you feedback. Good luck!

### Write user stories

In order to complete this exercise, you will need to download the QuickSeries app from the Apple App store or Google Play store:

* iOS: https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/quickseries/id1424521895
* Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quickseries.rca.quickseries

Launch the app, and using the top left Hamburger menu, navigate to the Feedback module. Create user stories for any or all of the following screens:

* Categories screen
* Having a technical problem screen
* Report a bug screen

### Release notes

Below you will find a list of users stories, improvements and bug fixes that are part of a release. In order to communicate these changes to the end-users, you must write a release note than can be understood by non technical individuals.

We understand that you have limited information to work with, so don't worry about being vague or even inventing something around a bug, improvement or feature.
